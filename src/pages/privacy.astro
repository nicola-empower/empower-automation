                <h3>3. How We Use Your Data</h3>
                <p>

                    use your contact details to send unsolicited marketing emails
                    or newsletters. We use your data solely for the following purposes:

                        (e.g., sending you your ROI calculation).
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Data Retention & Destruction Policy</h3>

                        > for our business records, after which it is permanently
                        deleted.
                    </li>

                        Once the work is complete and you have signed off as happy,
                        <strong
                            >all access credentials and sensitive client data
                            are destroyed immediately.</strong>
                    </li>
                </ul>
