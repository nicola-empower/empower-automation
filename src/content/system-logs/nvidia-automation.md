# Automation Is Having A Moment

**Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang just told his 36,000-strong team that it is “insane” not to automate every task possible with AI and that he wants “every task that is possible to be automated.”**

At the same time, Nvidia has grown from 29,600 employees to 36,000 in just one year and still believes it is about 10,000 people short of what it needs. That combination – more automation and more hiring – sends a clear message to every business: automation is not about getting rid of people; it is about freeing them to do more valuable work.

Across the industry, other tech leaders share the same direction of travel. Microsoft has told managers that using AI tools is now “core to every role,” and internal AI usage is starting to show up in performance conversations. Google and other large firms are pushing employees to become more “AI-savvy,” treating automation skills as a basic part of modern work rather than a niche specialty.

## Where Code-Based Automation Fits In

It is easy to read these headlines and think automation only counts if it uses advanced AI models, but that misses a huge piece of the story. Nvidia’s own engineers rely on tools like AI coding assistants, yet every one of those tools ultimately produces code that has to be robust, secure, and maintainable. Underneath the shiny AI layer is the same thing you build with Google Apps Script: reliable, predictable automation that quietly runs every day without drama.

For small businesses, that reliability matters even more than “cutting-edge” AI. A Google Apps Script that cleans up spreadsheets, routes emails, or syncs data between systems can run for years with minimal changes, delivering value long after the initial project is finished. While big tech experiments with “use it until it works” AI workflows, your clients benefit from “build it once, and it keeps working” automation that they can trust.

## Automation Creates Jobs, It Doesn’t Eliminate Them

Huang’s comments directly challenged the fear that automation will destroy jobs, pointing out that Nvidia hired “several thousand” people in a single quarter and is still aggressively recruiting worldwide. That hiring surge is happening at the exact same time the company is asking employees to automate as much as they can, which shows that automation and headcount growth can go hand in hand.

What actually changes is the type of work people do. When low-value, repetitive tasks are automated, teams can shift toward strategy, creativity, customer relationships, and innovation – the kind of work that justifies new roles and promotions instead of redundancies. This is the same opportunity for small businesses using Google Apps Script: move human energy away from copy‑pasting and calendar juggling, and toward sales, service, and growth.

## Google Apps Script As “Human-Centric” Automation

The big tech message is clear: automation is now a baseline expectation for modern teams, not a nice‑to‑have. But most small businesses do not have the budget or appetite to build complex AI infrastructure, and they should not have to. Google Apps Script offers a practical, code-first alternative that sits inside tools they already use, like Gmail, Sheets, and Calendar.

That makes coded automation uniquely human-centric. Instead of treating staff as something to be replaced, it treats their time as something to be protected: scripts handle the tedious admin so people can focus on the work only they can do. In a world where Nvidia is urging employees to automate everything and still claims it is 10,000 hires short, the real competitive advantage for small businesses will belong to those who quietly build their own “mini-Nvidias” – combining solid, boring, dependable automation with the kind of human judgment no AI can match.
