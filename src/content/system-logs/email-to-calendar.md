# Never Forget a Follow-Up Again: Turn Any Email into a Google Calendar Event

Let’s be honest, the mental to-do list is endless. Whether you’re running a business, managing a household, or both, there are a million tiny tasks to keep track of. For me, one of the most important and anxiety-inducing tasks is managing my son's repeat prescriptions.

I’d send the email request to the GP, and then the mental countdown would begin. Did they receive it? When will it be ready? When should I go to the pharmacy? Adding that worry to an already overflowing plate was stressful. I knew there had to be a better way. What if sending that one email could do the remembering for me?

## The “Secret Weapon”: A Peek Behind the Curtain

The magic comes from a little-known but incredibly powerful tool called Google Apps Script. It’s the engine that allows for truly custom workflows to be built directly within Google Workspace. Critically, these scripts process data securely within Google’s ecosystem, making them inherently GDPR-friendly as they adhere to Google’s robust data protection standards. I created a simple script that acts as my personal assistant for my son's epilepsy medication. Here’s how it works:

### 1. It Watches My “Sent” Box
The script keeps an eye out for any email I send to the GP, with “[Childs Name]” in the subject. It’s my digital gatekeeper.

### 2. It Reads the Date
As soon as I hit “send,” the script wakes up, reads the current date and time, and gets to work instantly.

### 3. It Does the Maths
It automatically calculates a future date three working days ahead, intelligently skipping weekends to find the right day.

### 4. It Creates the Event
Finally, it pops a detailed event into my Google Calendar, titled with the exact medication I need to collect. Job done.

> “Before this, my mental to-do list was a disaster. I was constantly worried I’d forget to follow up with a client or miss an important deadline. The ‘Email to Calendar’ script has completely changed that. Now, sending an email instantly creates a calendar event, so I can forget about the admin and focus on my work. It’s given me back hours of time and, more importantly, a huge amount of peace of mind.”

## From Prescriptions to Proposals: A Tool for Life & Business

This automation was a game-changer for my personal peace of mind, but I quickly realised the exact same logic is a powerhouse for business. It can be customised for almost any workflow. Here are just a few practical examples:

*   **Sales & Quoting:** Automatically schedule a follow-up after sending a proposal.
*   **Client Onboarding:** Email a welcome pack and trigger a series of check-in reminders for you and your client.
*   **Project Management:** Send a brief to a contractor and create a deadline reminder in your shared calendar.
*   **E-commerce:** Log a customer query from an email into a spreadsheet and set a reminder to check for a resolution.
*   **Personal Finance:** Forward a bill and automatically create a payment reminder two days before the due date.

Technology advisors agree that this consistency is key for boosting client communication and satisfaction.

> “This automation is a total game-changer for my business. I use it to automatically schedule follow-ups after sending a sales proposal. It ensures every single client gets a consistent, professional follow-up without me ever having to remember to do it. It’s the kind of subtle but powerful tool that makes you look incredibly organized and on top of your game.”

The bottom line is that automation isn’t just a “nice to have” – it’s a core business strategy. It allows you to save a huge amount of time, frees you from the mental load of remembering, and can even lead to significant cost savings by reducing manual admin work.

> “I used to waste so much time chasing down clients and contractors. Now, I use the script to automatically set reminders the moment I send a brief or a project update. It’s totally streamlined my project management process and nothing ever slips through the cracks. It’s one of the best investments I’ve made for my business.”
